# Mall Customers Clustering Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing customer data from a mall dataset to understand customer segments. The analysis includes visualizing data distributions and applying K-means clustering. This document provides an overview of the technologies and modules used in the project.

## Technologies and Modules Used

- **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. Used for loading and handling the dataset.

- **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing in Python. Provides support for arrays and mathematical functions.

- **Seaborn:** A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. Used for creating distribution plots and density plots.

- **Matplotlib:** A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Used for plotting the data distributions.

- **Scikit-Learn:** A machine learning library for Python that includes tools for clustering and other machine learning tasks. Used for applying K-means clustering to identify customer segments.

- **Warnings:** A module for managing warnings in Python. Used to suppress warnings that may arise during execution.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Analyze and visualize the distribution of customer attributes such as age, annual income, and spending score.

- **Density Visualization:** Compare income distributions across different customer genders using density plots.

- **Clustering Analysis:** Apply K-means clustering to determine optimal customer segments based on annual income.

## Installation

To replicate this analysis, ensure you have Python installed and use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
